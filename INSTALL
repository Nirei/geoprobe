Install
=======

If you haven't, install python3 and pip3 by whatever means provided by your
distro.
Then install dependencies with:
	
	sudo pip3 install pyric scapy geohash_hilbert pygle
	
After that, you'll need to get a WiGLE API token and properly configure it.
You can do so in https://wigle.net/account after registering for an account.
Then you will need to copy that token into $PYTHONPATH/pygle/config.py
- The part provided as "API name" goes in the 'user' variable in the file.
- The part provided as "API token" goes in the 'key' variable in the file.

That is everything you need to use geoprobe.

# geoprobe
A command line version proof-of-concept of what Zahori (a GUI application that does a better job at what this tool does, in case you are wondering) should do that I'll actually manage to finish before deadline so I can turn my report in and get extra credit.

Also, GitHub recommends didactit-fortnight as a name for this repository, I think you should know.

geoprobe is a tool to sniff, collect and geolocate 802.11 ProbeRequests using WiGLE API.
